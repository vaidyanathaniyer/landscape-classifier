## Problem Statement
Implementation of a Machine Learning Model for Landscape Classification.

## Project Goals
- Develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying different landcover types in satellite images.
- Create a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for image processing and analysis.
- Utilize the UCMerced_LandUse dataset for training and validation.
- Generate an output image with highlighted areas representing various landcover types.
- Demonstrate the potential application of the technology in aviation for real-time analysis of topography during flight.

## Project Objectives and Scope
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the provided dataset.
- Implement a CLI for users to input satellite images for analysis.
- Classify landcover types such as water, sand, forest, wetland, roadways, snow/ice, and manmade areas.
- Demonstrate the potential application of the technology in the aviation industry for aerial scanning and real-time topography analysis during flight.

## Working of the Model
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - The UCMerced_LandUse dataset is utilized for training and validation.
   - Images are loaded and preprocessed, including resizing and normalization.
   
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - A CNN model is created using Keras with layers for convolution, activation, pooling, flattening, and dense.
   - The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained on the dataset with 21 landcover classes.
   - Training is performed for 50 epochs with a batch size of 64.

4. **Image Prediction**:
   - The CLI accepts an input image path.
   - Preprocessing is applied to the input image.
   - The trained model predicts the class probabilities for the input image.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The predicted class probabilities are used to generate an output image.
   - The output image highlights different landcover types using color-coded sections.
